- Added an AbstractNumericalMethod class, with child classes:
  ForwardEulerNumericalMethod
  RK4NumericalMethod
  BackwardEulerNumericalMethod
  AdamsMoulton2NumericalMethod
  DOP853NumericalMethod
  
- OffLatticeSimulation now has an AbstractNumericalMethod as a member.
  A backward-compatible constructor exists that makes a ForwardEulerNumericalMethod before calling the new constructor. 
  The AbstractNumericalMethod is archived by the OffLatticeSimulation and is therefore set appropriately on loading.
